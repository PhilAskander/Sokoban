# PS4a: Sokoban

## Contact
Name: Philopater Askander
Section: 203
Time to Complete: 50 hours


## Description
The purpose of the project was to create a game, sokoban, that displays the UI of the game, but does not include the game functions
### Features
For my program, I went with a rather unusual approach. I decided to put everything in a two dimensional matrix and store that data into a map. Then go into that map and display the image that corresponded to the matching symbol. 
### Memory
I stored my level in the "getLevel" function, which reads the file that is passed in by the user when compiling.
### Lambdas
Describe what <algorithm> functions you used and what lambda expressions you wrote.

### Issues
My biggest issue that is occuring right now is that the file stores all the data horizontally, rather than vertically and horizontally, which gives me problems when attempting to display the game's UI.
### Extra Credit
Anything special you did.  This is required to earn bonus points.


## Acknowledgements
